    •   TA.cpp

    •   Makefile

How to run the project:

    1. In your Sleepinging-TA---Process-Synchronization directory open a terminal.
        NOTE: Make sure you are in the appropriate directory when opening the terminal. ../Sleeping-TA---Procress-Synchronization

    1a.  (Optional) Before you continue, look into the Sleeping-TA---Process-Synchronization directory and see if there are existing TA.o and TA.
        If those files exist in the directory, delete those files or type "make clean" in to the terminal and press ENTER.
        If those files do not exist in the firectory, continue to step 2.

    2. Type:

        make

        into the terminal and press ENTER. This compiles the TA.cpp

    3. Type:

        ./TA

        into the second terminal and press ENTER. This will run the (Sleeping) TA program.

    4. The (Sleeping) TA program will continue to run until you terminate the program by pressing "Ctrl + C" at the same time.
